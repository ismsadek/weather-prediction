# weather-prediction
Web app to look up the current weather in all the cities in Spain

Things to do:

- Creating the front part (UX/UI)
- Back-end part with Node and Express to make a GET route to access the data
- The client consult the current weather and the CO emission of the city selected ( we have to call two APIs)
- If the client registers, when the CO level is high in the city (tracking the ubication) automatically the   
  app will send an email telling that the air pollution is starting to be dangerous.
